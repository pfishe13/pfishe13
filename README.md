### Hi there 😁

## My name is Parker Fisher!

I am a design-oriented developer hoping to land my first job as a front end developer. I recently graduated from Kent State University with a BS in Computer Science. Since then, I have been working on The Odin Project, a full stack web development curriculum that has provided me with so much useful information regarding web development and programming in general. 

## Some of my skills 💪🏼🤩
- Languages
  - JavaScript
  - React
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - C++
  - Python (very little)
- Version Control
  - Git
  - GitHub
- Design
  - Adobe Photoshop
  - Adobe Illustrator
  - Wireframing

Other than learning and working on projects, I enjoy watching basketball 🏀, working out 🏋🏼‍♂️, buying overpriced shoes 👟, and facetiming my 2 year old neice 📱.

Thanks for reading to the end! If you want, connect with me on my other socials!
